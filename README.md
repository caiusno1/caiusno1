Hi there ðŸ‘‹.  
My name is Kai Biermeier. I am currently working for Paderborn University as part of the transregional collaborative research center 318 "Constructing Explainability" (
[TRR 318](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/))  
We research how AI can be explained using everyday explainations and via co-construction. My role is that of a techical assistant for empirical research. I create material, write scripts to analyse the results and also help with "everyday problems".  
In paralell, I am still studying computer science on master level. I will soon write my master thesis :).  
I am interested in Human Computer Interaction, Consistency, Model-Driven Engineering, Cognitive Psychology and Explainability ...  
You can reach me via my blog @ [https://blog.kai-biermeier.de](blog.kai-biermeier.de). Or via mail blog@kai-biermeier.de. I am most probably happy to answer your questions ;-).  
I am currious about the following technologies:
- Augmented Reality (MRTK, ARCore, Vuforia)
- the Eclipse Modelling Framework
- Docker (inkl. docker-compose)
- Kubernetes
- Angular
- Express
- NodeJs

I spend much of my freetime (when I like to code ;-)) on my [CatFrame](https://github.com/caiusno1/CatFrame), (Adding EMF import, adding Pattern-Matcher capabilities, build a UI, build examples, write unit tests)  
Public repos (until now):
- [CatFrame](https://github.com/caiusno1/CatFrame) Core Framework
- [CatFrameProMatch](https://github.com/caiusno1/CatFrameProMatch) Pattern Matcher for Graphs and Typed Graphs (until now)
